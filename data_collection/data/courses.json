Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available at the start of this century, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics. This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments.",

Over the course of the semester, students will design and perform multiple modern experiments and quantitatively analyze the results of these experiments. During this course students will also have an opportunity to use techniques learned during the course to experimentally answer an open question. Designing the experiments will require students to think critically about the biological context of the experiments as well as the necessary controls to ensure interpretable experimental results. During this course students will gain experience in many aspects of scientific research, including: sequencing DNA, designing and performing PCR for a variety of analyses, maintaining cell cultures, taking brightfield and fluorescent microscopy images, developing methods for automated analysis of cell images, communicating results to peers and colleagues. Course Outline: (1) 3-hour lab per week, (1) 1-hour lecture per week. Modern biological research is heavily interdisciplinary in nature requiring the use of a diverse set of experimental techniques and computational analysis. This course provides students with a modern research experience while training them to communicate and collaborate in an interdisciplinary setting to better prepare them to join the workforce as members of interdisciplinary teams.

    "description": "Computer systems and biological processes often rely on networks of interacting entities to reach joint decisions, coordinate and respond to inputs. There are many similarities in the goals and strategies of biological and computational systems which suggest that each can learn from the other. These include the distributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central control), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and the ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple applications and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. In this course we will start by discussing classic biologically motivated algorithms including neural networks (inspired by the brain), genetic algorithms (sequence evolution), non-negative matrix factorization (signal processing in the brain), and search optimization (ant colony formation). We will then continue to discuss more recent bi-directional studies that have relied on biological processes to solve routing and synchronization problems, discover Maximal Independent Sets (MIS), and design robust and fault tolerant networks. In the second part of the class students will read and present new research in this area. Students will also work in groups on a final project in which they develop and test a new biologically inspired algorithm. No prior biological knowledge required.

The rapid advances in single cell sequencing and other genomic technologies are revolutionizing how neuroscience research is conducted, providing tools to study how different cell types in the brain produce behavior and contribute to neurological disorders. Analyzing these powerful new datasets requires a foundation in molecular neuroscience as well as key computational biology techniques. In this course, we will cover the biology of epigenetics, how proteins sitting on DNA orchestrate the regulation of genes. In parallel, programming assignments and a project focusing on the analysis of a primary genomic dataset will teach principles of computational biology and their applications to neuroscience. The course material will also serve to demonstrate important concepts in neuroscience, including the diversity of neural cell types, neural plasticity, the role that epigenetics plays in behavior, and how the brain is influenced by neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although the course focuses on neuroscience, the material is accessible and applicable to a wide range of topics in biology.",

    "description": "Some of the most serious public health problems we face today, from drug-resistant bacteria, to cancer, all arise from a fundamental property of living systems and #8212; their ability to evolve. Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.",

    "description": "Proteomics and metabolomics are the large scale study of proteins and metabolites, respectively. In contrast to genomes, proteomes and metabolomes vary with time and the specific stress or conditions an organism is under. Applications of proteomics and metabolomics include determination of protein and metabolite functions (including in immunology and neurobiology) and discovery of biomarkers for disease. These applications require advanced computational methods to analyze experimental measurements, create models from them, and integrate with information from diverse sources. This course specifically covers computational mass spectrometry, structural proteomics, proteogenomics, metabolomics, genome mining and metagenomics. Automated scientific instruments are used widely in research and engineering. Robots dramatically increase the reproducibility of scientific experiments, and are often cheaper and faster than humans, but are most often used to execute brute-force sweeps over experimental conditions. The result is that many experiments are \"wasted\" on conditions where the effect could have been predicted. Thus, there is a need for computational techniques capable of selecting the most informative experiments. This course will introduce students to techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for automatically selecting experiments to accelerate the pace of discovery and to reduce the overall cost of research. Real-world applications from Biology, Bioengineering, and Medicine will be studied. Grading will be based on homeworks and two exams. The course is intended to be self-contained, but students should have a basic knowledge of biology, programming, statistics, and machine learning. The student will, under the individual guidance of a faculty member, read and digest process papers or a textbook in an advanced area of computational biology not offered by an existing course at Carnegie Mellon.

    "description": "Computer systems and biological processes often rely on networks of interacting entities to reach joint decisions, coordinate and respond to inputs. There are many similarities in the goals and strategies of biological and computational systems which suggest that each can learn from the other. These include the distributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central control), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and the ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple applications and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. In this course we will start by discussing classic biologically motivated algorithms including neural networks (inspired by the brain), genetic algorithms (sequence evolution), non-negative matrix factorization (signal processing in the brain), and search optimization (ant colony formation). We will then continue to discuss more recent bi-directional studies that have relied on biological processes to solve routing and synchronization problems, discover Maximal Independent Sets (MIS), and design robust and fault tolerant networks. In the second part of the class students will read and present new research in this area. Students will also work in groups on a final project in which they develop and test a new biologically inspired algorithm.

In contrast to genomes, proteomes and metabolomes vary with time and the specific stress or conditions an organism is under. Applications of proteomics and metabolomics include determination of protein and metabolite functions (including in immunology and neurobiology) and discovery of biomarkers for disease. These applications require advanced computational methods to analyze experimental measurements, create models from them, and integrate with information from diverse sources. This course specifically covers computational mass spectrometry, structural proteomics, proteogenomics, metabolomics, genome mining and metagenomics. This course will introduce students to the theory and practice of modeling biological systems from the molecular to the organism level with an emphasis on intracellular processes. Topics covered include kinetic and equilibrium descriptions of biological processes, systematic approaches to model building and parameter estimation, analysis of biochemical circuits modeled as differential equations, modeling the effects of noise using stochastic methods, modeling spatial effects, and modeling at higher levels of abstraction or scale using logical or agent-based approaches. A range of biological models and applications will be considered including gene regulatory networks, cell signaling, and cell cycle regulation. Weekly lab sessions will provide students hands-on experience with methods and models presented in class. Course requirements include regular class participation, bi-weekly homework assignments, a take-home exam, and a final project. The course is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students with a wide variety of backgrounds. The course is intended to be self-contained but students may need to do some additional work to gain fluency in core concepts. Students should have a basic knowledge of calculus, differential equations, and chemistry as well as some previous exposure to molecular biology and biochemistry.

Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.",

    "description": "Automated scientific instruments are used widely in research and engineering. Robots dramatically increase the reproducibility of scientific experiments, and are often cheaper and faster than humans, but are most often used to execute brute-force sweeps over experimental conditions. The result is that many experiments are \"wasted\" on conditions where the effect could have been predicted. Thus, there is a need for computational techniques capable of selecting the most informative experiments. This course will introduce students to techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for automatically selecting experiments to accelerate the pace of discovery and to reduce the overall cost of research. Real-world applications from Biology, Bioengineering, and Medicine will be studied. Grading will be based on homeworks and two exams. The course is intended to be self-contained, but students should have a basic knowledge of biology, programming, statistics, and machine learning. Computational biologists frequently focus on analyzing and modeling large amounts of biological data, often from high-throughput assays or diverse sources. It is therefore critical that students training in computational biology be familiar with the paradigms and methods of experimentation and measurement that lead to the production of these data. This one-semester laboratory course gives students a deeper appreciation of the principles and challenges of biological experimentation. Students learn a range of topics, including experimental design, structural biology, next generation sequencing, genomics, proteomics, bioimaging, and high-content screening. Class sessions are primarily devoted to designing and performing experiments in the lab using the above techniques. Students are required to keep a detailed laboratory notebook of their experiments and summarize their resulting data in written abstracts and oral presentations given in class-hosted lab meetings. With an emphasis on the basics of experimentation and broad views of multiple cutting-edge and high-throughput techniques, this course is appropriate for students who have never taken a traditional undergraduate biology lab course, as well as those who have and are looking for introductory training in more advanced approaches.

Numerical computing provides methods to approximate these solutions using computational techniques. It combines mathematics and programming to solve real-world problems such as simulations, optimization, and data analysis. The course begins with a review of key mathematical concepts like vector spaces, matrices, and calculus. We then explore how numbers are represented on computers, the types of errors that can occur, and strategies to handle them. Core topics include solving linear and nonlinear systems, eigenvalue problems, optimization, and techniques such as LU decomposition, QR factorization, and singular value decomposition (SVD). We will also cover iterative methods for large systems, interpolation, numerical differentiation, integration, and both ordinary and partial differential equations. Students will gain hands-on experience implementing algorithms and learn to balance accuracy, stability, and efficiency in computational solutions.",

Examples of such components include cars in city traffic, pedestrians moving in crowds, firms competing in a market, ants foraging for food, or mobile robots in a swarm or multi-robot system. Under certain conditions, such systems can produce useful system-level behaviors, display self-organized spatial-temporal patterns, effectively perform computations, information dissemination, and decision-making. Loosely speaking, when this happens we can say that the system is displaying a form of \"collective intelligence\". Collective intelligence will expose students to relevant mathematical and computational models from following fields and domains: Cellular automata and Random boolean networks, Social choice, Game theory, Distributed consensus, Task allocation, Swarm intelligence, Social networks, Pattern formation, and Self-organizing maps.

    "description": "Symbolic logic is fundamental to computer science, providing a foundation for the theory of programming languages, database theory, AI, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, interactive theorem proving, and formal verification. Formal methods based on logic complement statistical methods and machine learning by providing rules of inference and means of representation with precise semantics. These methods are central to hardware and software verification, and have also been used to solve open problems in mathematics. This course will introduce students to logic on three levels: theory, implementation, and application. It will focus specifically on applications to automated reasoning and interactive theorem proving. We will present the underlying mathematical theory, and students will develop the mathematical skills that are needed to design and reason about logical systems in a rigorous way. We will also show students how to represent logical objects in a functional programming language, Lean, and how to implement fundamental logical algorithms. We will show students how to use contemporary automated reasoning tools, including SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and first-order theorem provers to solve challenging problems. Finally, we will show students how to use Lean as an interactive theorem prover.",

About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area. The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: \"HCI gadgets\").

The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student. There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers.

To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. The intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly participate in when you move to a work environment, and strategies for improving communication within your groups.

    "description": "\"Why are things so hard to use these days? Why doesn't this thing I just bought work? Why is this web site so hard to use? These are frustrations that we have all faced from systems not designed with people in mind. The question this course will focus on is: how can we design human-centered systems that people find useful and usable? This course is a broad introduction to designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces. If you take only one course in Human-Computer Interaction, this is the course for you. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from Human-Computer Interaction. Coursework includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group projects. This class is open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or non-technical majors. However, there is a programming prerequisite. \" Course Website: [http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/courses/designing-human-centered-software](http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/courses/designing-human-centered-software)05-395 Applications of Cognitive ScienceSpring: 9 units The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally. The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product, a change in practice, or a legal statute. Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes. The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting. The questions to be considered include: What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable? What is the pathway from laboratory to practice? What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice? The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students. They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary. The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition. These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.

It introduces students to tools, techniques, and sources of information about HCI and provides a systematic approach to design. The course increases awareness of good and bad design through observation of existing technology and teaches the basic skills of generative and evaluative research methods. This is a companion course to courses in visual design (51-422) and software implementation (05-430, [05-431](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=05-431 \"05-431\")). When registering for this course, undergraduate students are automatically placed the wait list. Students will be then moved into the class, based on if they are in the BHCI second major and year in school e.g. seniors, juniors, etc. In the Fall, this course is NOT open to students outside the HCI major. The Spring offering is open to all students. This course is a core requirement for students in the HCI additional major. This course uses theory and research from human factors, cognitive science, and social science to understand and design the interactions of humans with the built world, tools, and technology. The course emphasizes current work in applied domains such as automotive design, house construction, medical human factors, and design of information devices. The course also will emphasize not only individual human factors (e.g., visual response, anthropometry) but also the organizational arrangements that can amplify or correct human factors problems. Through reading, discussion, and projects, you will learn about human perceptual, cognitive, and physical processes that affect how people interact with, and use, technology and tools. You will learn why we have so many automobile accidents, voting irregularities, and injuries from prescription medication. You will learn some tried and true solutions for human factors problems, and some of the many problems in human factors that remain. You will also have gained experience in research in this field.

However, it is a significant challenge to create a game that is both fun and educational. In this course, students will learn to meet this challenge by combining processes and principles from game design and instructional design. Students will also learn to evaluate their games for fun, learning, and the integration of the two. They will be guided by the EDGE framework for the analysis and design educational games. The course will involve a significant hands-on portion, in which students learn a design process to create educational games digital or non-digital. They will also read about existing educational games and discuss game design, instructional design, learning and transfer, and the educational effectiveness of digital games. They will analyze an educational game and present their analysis to the class.

It considers factors of input, output, application interface, and related infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them. It considers how these aspects are organized and managed within a well-structured object oriented system. We will cover a variety of \"front-end\" programming contexts, including conventional graphical user interface (GUI) programming for mobile apps (phones, watches), web apps, and regular desktop applications, across a variety of frameworks. We will also cover programming for data-driven and conversational (AI) user interfaces. We will briefly touch on front-end programming for visualizations, games, 3D, and virtual and artificial reality (VR and AR), along with interactive UI tools such as prototypers and resource editors. The homeworks and project in this course will involve extensive object-oriented programming, likely in both Java and JavaScript, so this course is only appropriate for students with a strong programming background. Note that this is not an HCI methods course and #8212; we do not cover user-centered design or evaluation methods. This course is designed for students in the SCS HCI undergrad Major, but it also available to any undergrad or graduate student with an interest in the topic and solid prior programming experience who wish to understand the structures needed for professional development of interactive systems. Note that all students who register for this class will initially be placed on a waitlist. Priority for getting into the class are students in the HCII programs (more senior students first), and then others.

Course Website: [https://hcii.cmu.edu/course/software-structures-user-interfaces-ssui](https://hcii.cmu.edu/course/software-structures-user-interfaces-ssui)05-432 Personalized Online LearningFall: 12 units Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences. This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so. The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction. The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design.

It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization. 05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.",

    "description": "Good design is a continuous improvement process that combines scientific principles and data-driven methods to achieve desired outcomes. E-learning design is no exception. In this course, you will learn how to design innovative e-learning, that is, online interactions and technology that make learning more effective and efficient. You will practice instructional design using learning science theories and principles and learning engineering using data-driven methods to discover insights about how learners think. Instructional designers explain and use principles of learning and instruction such as proven ways to support learning-by-doing, like deliberate practice and self-explanation, and proven ways to support multimedia learning from text, visuals, and audio. They employ \"backward design\": designing and aligning learning goals, the assessments that measure them, and the instruction that achieves them. But today's learning engineers do not simply design in sequence and #8212; goals then assessments then instruction and #8212; but are agile and iterative. They collect qualitative data, for example, by having an expert \"think aloud\" while performing one of their assessments and use the results to add or change goals. They collect and use quantitative data, for example, by mining learning data from online course interactions or by comparing alternative designs in an A/B experiment. By using data, learning engineers create innovative and effective designs unlike the results of others who rely on science and intuition alone. You will do so too in an end-to-end e-learning design project, where you develop an e-learning module of your choice, continuously improve it, and test it in an A/B experiment.

We will examine what it means to make a \"good\" tool for learning, why it is hard, and how you can create and prototype them. The bulk of this class centers around three learning mechanics: feedback and active learning, collaboration between learners, and data-driven improvement. Using these mechanics as specific case studies, the class will teach students how to think about, build, and study tools for online learning both for formal, classroom education, and informal learning. While we cover learning science principles, the focus of this course will be on the application of those principles as they are used in a variety of learning tools. The ultimate goal of this course is to give you hands-on experience working with a variety of tools, and through doing so, learning how to better design, improve, and utilize them for all types of learners.

Why do YouTube mega-influencers with tens of millions of subscribers exist, yet we have not heard of most of them? Why do echo chambers form and polarization deepen in social media platforms despite the utopian promise of the free flow of information and fluid connectivity between people that these platforms had envisioned? How do professionals land their dream jobs? How does mass adoption of technological innovations happen (e.g., Python, Bitcoin)? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of social connections that people form on and offline. This course offers an introduction to the study of social networks as a powerful tool for understanding a wide range of questions and for solving real-world problems arising at the intersection of human social behavior and technological systems. The course first introduces network concepts and their mathematical operationalizations that give social network analysis the versatility for rigorous quantitative analysis. Students will subsequently learn how these building blocks have been applied to analyze and solve a wide range of online social phenomena. Finally, the course will introduce statistical models of networks that enable principled investigation of network formation mechanisms. Throughout this course, students will work towards a final team project that applies network concepts and measures to either (a) describe and/or explain an empirically puzzling social phenomenon with network data, (b) develop a network data collection pipeline that aims to solve a real-world problem, or (c) build a system utiziling the insights from the course that solves a real-world problem. The following class activities throughout the course are intended to support and augment the final project.",

To appropriately build and deploy these systems developers should know not only about development tools such as container management tools but also the structure of the cloud - in particular how it utilizes virtual machines, containers and networks. They should also understand security mechanisms both in the internet and how to authorize users and maintain credentials securely. Finally, to protect the system once it is placed into production, a developer needs to know how to enable the detection of problems during execution through collection and navigation of logs produced by the system.

    "description": "\\*\\*Previously Course number 17213\\*\\* Have you wondered how Linux and the subsequent development of open-source software ecosystems could thrive despite weak economic incentives? Why do large-scale complex software systems sometimes fail despite well-developed guardrails and practices? What makes a recommendation system on social media so effective and so toxic at the same time? Why do YouTube mega-influencers with tens of millions of subscribers exist, yet each of us only recognize a handful of them at best? Why do echo chambers form and polarization deepen in social media platforms despite the utopian promise of frictionless connectivity that these platforms initially envisioned? How can you land your dream jobs? How does mass adoption of technological innovations happen (e.g., Python, Bitcoin)? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of on- and offline social connections, communications, and collaborations that people form with one another. This course offers an introduction to the study of social networks as a powerful tool for formalizing these wide range of questions, for understanding social dynamics in various settings, and for solving real-world problems arising at the intersection of human social behavior and technological systems. The course first introduces network science concepts and their mathematical operationalization's that give rigorous definitions to fuzzy words we use to describe the social world, such as \"status\" and \"social group\". Students will subsequently learn how these network concepts were used to analyze and solve a wide range of puzzling online social phenomena. Finally, the course will introduce statistical models of networks that enable principled investigation of network formation mechanisms.

Energy is a key societal resource. However, our energy usage is rising at an alarming rate and therefore it has become critical to manage its consumption more efficiently for long term sustainability. This course introduces students to the exciting area of \"Green Computing\", and is organizationally divided into two tracks. The first track is \"Energy-Efficient Computing\", which considers the state of the art techniques for improving the energy efficiency of mobile devices, to laptop and desktop class computers and finally to data centers. We will cover energy efficiency across the hardware/software stack, starting from the individual components like processors and radio interfaces to system level architectures and optimizations. The second track is \"Applying Computing towards Sustainability\", covering topics that leverage computing to reduce the energy footprint of our society. In particular, we will focus on Smart Buildings and the Smart Grid, covering topics such as sensing, modeling and controlling the energy usage of buildings, new operating systems or software stacks for the smart infrastructure, as well as the privacy and security issues with the new \"internet of things\". The goal of this course is to help students acquire some of the knowledge and the skills needed to do research in this space of \"Green Computing\". Although the course is listed within SCS, it should be of interest to students in several departments, including ECE, MechE, CEE, EPP and Architecture.",

    "description": "DevOps: Engineering for Deployment and Operations\": DevOps is the term given to a modern movement to establish practices that significantly reduce the time to production of committed code. This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays. Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems.

This rapid rate of change has often resulted in a public which does not understand the technologies shaping their lives and lawmakers who are poorly equipped to make sound policy. It is therefore incumbent upon specialists to communicate how ICTs work to the public and lawmakers so policy making is shaped by evidence and reflects public desires. This course will train students to be effective communicators and advocates in the ICT space. Students taking this course will learn about the broader scope of technology policymaking including formal lawmaking, agency rule-making, strategic litigation, and corporate social responsibility. Current ICT policy topics in privacy, free expression, net neutrality, and competition will be covered. Public communication strategies such as writing op-eds, interviewing with journalists, producing explanatory videos and interactive games will be explored. Finally, students will learn how to perform an expert role in areas such as writing policy briefs and providing testimony. The course is open to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Graduate students whose research has public policy implications are encouraged to develop projects related to their research. There is no requirement for programming knowledge, but students with experience in developing interactive media and games will be encouraged to utilize such skills. The class will focus heavily on readings, critical evaluation of real ICT advocacy campaigns, and homework will provide hands-on experience with numerous strategies for public engagement.

The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products; prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments; and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external non-technical stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers. This is an engineering-focused course; no entrepreneurship background is required or expected. Students do not need to have a startup idea to participate fully. This course provides a broad and pragmatic foundation in the most basic tool of the programmer: programming languages. It starts with the fundamentals of syntax, parsing, and binding, the core structural concepts in programming languages. The course will then cover program semantics and type systems, and students will learn to relate them with a type soundness theorem. Finally, a coverage of intermediate optimization and code generation offers the opportunity to discuss both producing efficient code and reasoning about the correctness of program transformations. Assignments involve a combination of tool-assisted formal reasoning and proofs about programming languages, and implementing these language constructs in a compiler. This course fulfills the Logic and amp; Languages constrained elective of the B.S. in Computer Science.

It discusses how to take an idea and a model developed by a data scientist (e.g., scripts and Jupyter notebook) and deploy it as part of scalable and maintainable system (e.g., mobile apps, web applications, IoT devices). Rather than focusing on modeling and learning itself, this course assumes a working relationship with a data scientist and focuses on issues of design, implementation, operation, and assurance and how those interact with the data scientist's modeling. This course is aimed at software engineers who want to understand the specific challenges of working with AI components and at data scientists who want to understand the challenges of getting a prototype model into production; it facilitates communication and collaboration between both roles.

Will a law legislating sanctions against social media platforms that spread disinformation stop the spread? We live and work in complex adaptive and evolving socio-technical systems where questions such as these arise constantly. Questions such as these are often only addressable through computational modeling, i.e., through simulation. Simulation models are a critical method for understanding how to adaptation and learning will change the status-quo. Computational modeling can be used to help analyze, reason about, predict the behavior of, and possibly control complex human systems of \"networked\" agents. Using simulation it is possible to advance theory, test policies before enacting them, and think through non-linear social effects.

    "description": "This advanced course studies the nature of software bugs and security vulnerabilities arising in complex application domains and surveys specialized program analysis + automated testing techniques for identifying such issues proactively. The course will take a tour of various domains such as mobile systems, databases, web browsers, distributed and networked systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart contracts. For each domain, the class will review case studies of high-impact software bugs that have manifested in production and will then discuss state-of-the-art research techniques that aim to uncover such bugs automatically. Apart from the literature review, students will engage significantly with software system design and engineering via hands-on assignments and a semester-long project involving real-world applications and analysis tools for one or more domains. Students completing this course will be able to (a) identify practical challenges of applying well-known program analysis and testing techniques to complex application domains, (b) formulate and leverage domain-specific assumptions for making analysis techniques tractable in a specialized setting, and (c) build practical tools for improving software quality in large-scale systems. The course assumes that students have some background in reasoning about software quality, system security, and/or working with program representations. The course builds upon mathematical principles introduced in foundational classes on program analysis, verification, or compiler design, as well as system design principles encountered in introductory security or software engineering courses.

Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, Web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed - statistical disclosure limitation (as may be used by the census bureau in releasing statistics), semantics and logical specification of privacy policies that constrain information flow and use (e.g., by privacy regulations such as the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), principled audit and accountability mechanisms for enforcing privacy policies, anonymous communication protocols - and other settings in which privacy concerns have prompted much research, such as in social networks, location privacy and Web privacy (in particular, online tracking and amp; targeted advertising).

The course has three aims. (a) It is intended to stimulate new ways of formulating research questions on pressing/emerging societal issues of interest (e.g., political polarization, gender representation in open-source software development, decentralized governance based on blockchain technology) given the possibilities afforded by a wide array of digital trace data (e.g., social media, open-source software collaboration, cryptocurrency transactions, satellite imagery). This course will (b) discuss exemplary works in CSS that made novel discoveries or made theoretical and/or methodological breakthroughs and (c) cover practical considerations that commonly arise in a CSS research project cycle. These issues may include, but are not limited to, data collection (sampling methods and bias), repurposing existing datasets that were collected in a different research context, constructing metrics based on theoretical insights, analytic approaches adequate for a given research question (statistical modeling, network analysis, online experiments, simulation-based theory development), big data processing and analytic tools (distributed data processing frameworks, visualization), ethical considerations, and data sharing.

In the past decade there has been an explosion of interest in network science moving from the work on social networks and graph theory to statistical and computer simulation models. Network analysis, like statistics, now plays an role in most empirical fields. Network science is a broad and multi-disciplinary field. In this class, students will gain an appreciation of the history of the field, the difference between social networks and social media, the difference graph-based metrics for network analysis and graphical models, the use of traditional and high dimensional network models, and the advances in this field. Applications and issues discussed will include: social media analytics, semantic networks, task networks, organizational design and teams, machine learning and network analysis, generative models, terrorism and crime, health, and fake news. Methods for network data collection, analysis, visualization, and interpretation are covered.

Will a law legislating sanctions against social media platforms that spread disinformation stop the spread? We live and work in complex adaptive and evolving socio-technical systems where questions such as these arise constantly. Questions such as these are often only addressable through computational modeling, i.e., through simulation. Simulation models are a critical method for understanding how to adaptation and learning will change the status-quo. Computational modeling can be used to help analyze, reason about, predict the behavior of, and possibly control complex human systems of \"networked\" agents. Using simulation it is possible to advance theory, test policies before enacting them, and think through non-linear social effects.

To study this question, we will introduce differential privacy, a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide range of statistical analyses. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential privacy. Through the discussion of these results, we will also demonstrate some of the most novel and surprising connections between differential privacy and other areas of theoretical computer science, including machine learning theory, cryptography, convex geometry, and game theory. ### Language Technologies Institute Courses",

Discussion topics include: - Philosophical foundations: ethical philosophies, history, medical and psychological experiments, IRB and human subjects, ethical decision making, AI alignment. - Bias, Misrepresentation, Alignment: algorithms to identify biases in models and data and adversarial approaches to debiasing. - Civility in communication: techniques to monitor trolling, hate speech, abusive language, cyberbullying, toxic comments. - Democracy and the language of manipulation: approaches to identify propaganda and manipulation in news, to identify fake news, political framing. - Privacy and amp; security : algorithms for demographic inference, personality profiling, and anonymization of demographic and personal traits. - NLP for Social Good: Low-resource NLP, applications for disaster response and monitoring diseases, medical applications, psychological counseling, interfaces for accessibility. - Multidisciplinary perspective: invited lectures from experts in behavioral and social sciences, rhetoric, etc. Course Website: [https://maartensap.com/11830/](https://maartensap.com/11830/)11-439 Designing Around Patents on Machine Learning and NLP TechnologySpring: 9 units This course uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing as vehicles to teach principles in designing software to avoid patents. After introducing students to the basics of patents, we investigate how to use students software skills to design around patents that is, create new technology that avoids a patent while maintaining some, or even all, of the performance and value of the patented technology. Designing around a patent can be viewed as a puzzle that requires technical skill, understanding the business value of technology, knowledge of patents, and creativity. Students will also be able to help design patents that cannot be easily designed-around. Not only does this add a valuable new dimension to the student's skill set, the course material is organized as a vehicle for refining knowledge of ML and NLP techniques. We will practice by designing around patents on well-known ML and NLP algorithms. Students study the basic algorithm, learn the patents that cover those algorithms, and then experiment with software modifications that avoid the patent while preserving as much of the algorithm's performance as possible. In essence, students will view the presence of particular patents as a design constraints, akin to designing for limited memory, bandwidth, or processor speed. Students must have already taken courses in Natural Language Processing (e.g., [11-411](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=11-411 \"11-411\")) and Machine Learning (e.g., [10-315](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=10-315 \"10-315\")).

Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as \"deep learning\", familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their \"deep\" learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11-785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuous-evaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project. There will be six hands-on assignments, requiring both low-level coding and toolkit-based implementation of neural networks, covering basic MLP, convolutional and recurrent formalisms, as well as one or more advanced tasks, in addition to the final project. This course covers the use of computational methods in crime investigation (forensics) and prevention (intelligence). In almost all areas of forensics and intelligence, computational methods continue to aid, and sometimes entirely replace, human expertise in tracking crime. This is desirable since automation can address the problems associated with scale and global crime linkage through diverse data computational tools can potentially overcome and surpass human capabilities for crime investigation.

In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques. Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory prob and amp;stats course. This course is designed to plug this hole. The goal of \"Language and Statistics\" is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology. We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier). We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language. These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation. Topics include: Zipf's distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information; decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

Inference-time algorithms can be applied on top of an already-trained model to improve generation quality, lower latency, or induce additional controllability. Inference-time algorithms can allow users to run models on their laptop, serve millions of outputs at scale, or dramatically increase the quality of generations from a system without additional training. In this class, we survey the wide space of inference-time techniques with a particular focus on the implementation and practical use cases of such methods. Students will understand the different ways to implement and compare inference-time techniques, learn the theory behind different strategies for inference-time scaling of compute, and implement representative examples from several classes of inference-time algorithms. In the final project, students will apply inference-time strategies of their choice to two shared tasks: an open-ended generation task and a reasoning task.",

Prerequisite: [11-761](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=11-761 \"11-761\")11-763 Inference Algorithms for Language ModelingFall: 12 units As the use of massive and costly-to-train large language models has become increasingly commonplace, much academic and industry interest has focused on the methods used to generate outputs from these models - the inference process. Inference-time algorithms can be applied on top of an already-trained model to improve generation quality, lower latency, or induce additional controllability. Inference-time algorithms can allow users to run models on their laptop, serve millions of outputs at scale, or dramatically increase the quality of generations from a system without additional training. In this class, we survey the wide space of inference-time techniques with a particular focus on the implementation and practical use cases of such methods. Students will understand the different ways to implement and compare inference-time techniques, learn the theory behind different strategies for inference-time scaling of compute, and implement representative examples from several classes of inference-time algorithms. In the final project, students will apply inference-time strategies of their choice to two shared tasks: an open-ended generation task and a reasoning task.

In turn, humans have also evolved complex mechanisms for receiving these signals and inferring the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others. Proper understanding of human behavior, in all its nuance, requires careful consideration and integration of verbal, vocal, and visual information. These communication dynamics have long been studied in psychology and other social sciences. More recently, the field of multimodal affective computing has sought to enhance these studies using techniques from computer science and artificial intelligence. Common topics of study in this field include affective states, cognitive states, personality, psychopathology, social processes, and communication. As such, multimodal affective computing has broad applicability in both scientific and applied settings ranging from medicine and education to robotics and marketing. The objectives of this course are: (1) To give an overview of the components of human behavior (verbal, vocal, and visual) and the computer science areas that measure them (NLP, speech processing, and computer vision) (2) To provide foundational knowledge of psychological constructs commonly studied in multimodal affective computing (e.g., emotion, personality, and psychopathology) (3) To provide practical instruction on using statistical tools to study research hypotheses (4) To provide information about computational predictive models that integrate multimodal information from the verbal, vocal, and visual modalities (5) To give students practical experience in the computational study of human behavior and psychological constructs through an in-depth course project",

    "description": "Multimodal machine learning (MMML) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field which addresses some of the original goals of artificial intelligence by integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. With the initial research on audio-visual speech recognition and more recently with language vision projects such as image and video captioning, this research field brings some unique challenges for multimodal researchers given the heterogeneity of the data and the contingency often found between modalities. The course will present the fundamental mathematical concepts in machine learning and deep learning relevant to the five main challenges in multimodal machine learning: (1) multimodal representation learning, (2) translation and amp; mapping, (3) modality alignment, (4) multimodal fusion and (5) co-learning. These include, but not limited to, multimodal auto-encoder, deep canonical correlation analysis, multi-kernel learning, attention models and multimodal recurrent neural networks. We will also review recent papers describing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and computational algorithms for MMML and discuss the current and upcoming challenges. The course will discuss many of the recent applications of MMML including multimodal affect recognition, image and video captioning and cross-modal multimedia retrieval.

However, in many cases there remains a significant gap between the promise of modern language technologies, where models are typically benchmarked on a relatively limited set of representative \"general purpose\" tasks, and the successful deployment of these tools for real-world applications. In practice, each domain-specific task requires special consideration and/or adaptation, often consisting of task definition and dataset curation, experimentation to identify strengths and limitations of existing off-the-shelf methods, and the formulation of an appropriate and computationally/financially feasible plan for adapting available affordances to fit the new domain or task of interest. In this class, students with concentrations outside of NLP (e.g. degree programs in materials science or English) and students with concentrations in or near NLP (LTI, MLD or equivalent expertise) will work with and learn from each other to bridge this gap. Together, students will explore: - Technical foundations for using language technologies, AI literacy and effective science communication; - Acquiring and curating data appropriate to a specific task, evaluation; - Identifying strengths and limitations of various approaches for adaptation to a specific domain or setting, and; - Devising and executing a plan to accomplish research and analysis tasks given said goal.

They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.

This course explores the techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence that are driving the recent advances in generative modeling and foundation models. Students will understand, develop, and apply state-of-the-art algorithms that enable machines to generate realistic and creative content. Core topics will include: the fundamental mechanisms of learning; how to build generative models and other large foundation models (e.g. transformers for vision and language, diffusion models); how to train such models (pre-training, fine-tuning) and efficiently adapt them (adapters, in-context learning); how to scale up to massive datasets (multi-GPU/distributed optimization); how to employ existing models for everyday use (generating code, coding with a generative model in the loop). Students will also explore the theoretical foundations and empirical attempts to understand their inner workings as well as learn about the ways in which things can go wrong (bias, hallucination, adversarial attacks, data contamination) and ways to combat these problems. Students in the course will develop understanding of modern techniques through implementation, but they will also employ existing libraries and models to explore their generative capabilities and limitations.

Bayesian probability allows us to quantify, model and reason about all types of uncertainty. The result is a powerful, internally-consistent framework for approaching many problems that arise in machine learning, including parameter estimation, model comparison, and decision making. We will begin with a high-level introduction to Bayesian inference and show how it can be applied to familiar machine learning tasks, such as regression and classification. We will also introduce the workhouse model of the course: Gaussian processes, a flexible non-parametric model with many convenient properties. The second half of the course will cover more-advanced topics, with a heavy focus on probabilistic numerics. The field of probabilistic numerics seeks to apply probabilistic or statistical methods to find numerical solutions for intractable tasks, such as quadrature, global optimization and solving differential equations. Along the way, we will also consider how the techniques presented in class can be a) scaled to handle larger/higher-dimensional datasets and b) combined with active learning techniques to build adaptive models that can determine which data points should be observed next in order to most improve their performance.

    "description": "As machine learning grows in prominence, so also has optimization become a mainstay for machine learning, particularly techniques for convex optimization. Most learning problems are formulated as optimization of some objective function, sometimes subject to constraints. This course explores the optimization algorithms used to solve these machine learning problems. We characterize the properties of the optimization problems that enable these techniques to be efficient (e.g. convexity, smoothness, linearity, separability) as well as properties that inhibit efficient optimization (e.g. nonconvexity). Core topics include first order methods (gradient descent, subgradient methods, proximal and stochastic gradient descent), duality and linear programming, and second-order/quasi-Newton methods. We also consider advanced techniques ranging from those that have spurred the growth of deep learning (e.g. adaptive gradient methods, momentum) and those that enable large-scale distributed optimization. The course will focus both on theory and practical applications, frequently drawing motivation from examples in machine learning. The course is designed so that a machine learning (ML) course could be taken after or before this one; ML is not a prerequisite. Students will gain the tools to both implement and analyze modern optimization techniques.

They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity. The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student. The project will be designed to compare the scalability of variant learning algorithms on datasets. An introductory course in machine learning, like [10-601](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=10-601 \"10-601\") or [10-701](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=10-701 \"10-701\"), is a prerequisite or a co-requisite.

But as personal devices that interact with us in natural language become ubiquitous (e.g., Siri, Google Now), they open an amazing possibility of letting users teach machines in natural language, similar to how we teach each other. Conversation, as an interface to machine learning systems, opens a new paradigm that both unifies several existing machine learning paradigms (e.g., active learning, supervised learning), but also brings a unique set of advantages and challenges that lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. This course will be structured as a well-defined mini-challenge (project) course. We will present you with several well-defined open problems and provide you with recently collected datasets that can get you started immediately! But you will be free to define your own problem using that data as well, or come up with your own problem entirely. There are no other constraints, and since this is a new area of research, you can (and should) be creative and as crazy in coming up with methods to tackle them.

In the past decade, researchers across many communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception. The goal of this course is to introduce students to both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in deep learning. The first part of the course will focus on supervised learning, including neural networks, back-propagation algorithm, convolutional models, recurrent neural networks, and their extensions with applications to image recognition, video analysis, and language modelling. The second part of the course will cover unsupervised learning, including variational autoencoders, sparse-coding, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks. This course will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity and will require strong programming skills.

Structured prediction problems abound throughout application areas such as natural language processing, speech processing, computational biology, computer vision, healthcare, and many others. In this course, we will study modern approaches to structured prediction building on probabilistic graphical models, deep learning, and search. The course will focus on three key aspects: models, inference, and learning. The models we consider will focus on both generative and discriminative models such as Bayesian networks, Markov random fields (MRFs), conditional random fields (CRFs), and deep neural networks including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and #8212; as well as hybrids of graphical models and neural networks. The course will explore approaches to exact and approximate inference: junction tree algorithm, approximate marginal inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational methods, approximate MAP inference by integer linear programming (ILP) and search. We will explore unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning using different formulations of the learning problem: MLE, Bayesian inference, structured perceptron, M3Ns, learning to search, and autoencoders. Covered applications will include machine translation, speech recognition, DNA sequence analysis, scene understanding, medical diagnosis.

This course explores the techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence that are driving the recent advances in generative modeling and foundation models. Students will understand, develop, and apply state-of-the-art algorithms that enable machines to generate realistic and creative content. Core topics will include: the fundamental mechanisms of learning; how to build generative models and other large foundation models (e.g. transformers for vision and language, diffusion models); how to train such models (pre-training, fine-tuning) and efficiently adapt them (adapters, in-context learning); how to scale up to massive datasets (multi-GPU/distributed optimization); how to employ existing models for everyday use (generating code, coding with a generative model in the loop). Students will also explore the theoretical foundations and empirical attempts to understand their inner workings as well as learn about the ways in which things can go wrong (bias, hallucination, adversarial attacks, data contamination) and ways to combat these problems. Students in the course will develop understanding of modern techniques through implementation, but they will also employ existing libraries and models to explore their generative capabilities and limitations.

    "description": "Machine learning studies the question: \"how can we build adaptive algorithms that automatically improve their performance (on a given task) as they acquire more experience?\" This can cover a dizzying array of technologies depending on what sort of task we have in mind, and we take to constitute experience. Through this framing, we might view classical statistics problems, like estimating the likelihood that a coin lands on heads as an ML problem: the task is to produce an estimate, and the experience would consist of observations. But ML can also include robotics challenges, where the experience is acquired dynamically as our artificial agent interacts with the real world. Other grand challenges in machine learning relate to personalized medicine, natural language processing, and most recently generating media artifacts like photographs and essays (but don't ask chatGPT to do your homework). This course is designed to give PhD students a solid foundation in the methods, mathematics, and algorithms of modern machine learning.

Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems, though we will discuss some recent advances in nonconvex optimization. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken [10-701](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=10-701 \"10-701\") or an equivalent machine learning or statistical modeling class is strongly encouraged, as we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class. Students will work on an extensive optimization-based project throughout the semester.

The responsible development and use of AI requires the integration of ethical, societal, and policy considerations into the use of AI tools and the development of AI systems in high-stakes domains, such as employment, education, lending, criminal justice, medicine, and beyond. We will discuss: (1) the pathways through which AI can lead to or amplify problematic decision-making practices (e.g., discrimination, inscrutability, invasion of privacy, and beyond); (2) recent technological methods and remedies to capture and alleviate these concerns; and (3) the scope of applicability and limitations of technological remedies in the context of several contemporary application domains. The course's primary goals are: (a) to raise awareness about the social, ethical, and policy implications of AI, and (b) to prepare students to critically analyze these issues as they emerge in the ever-expanding use of AI in socially consequential domains.

Creativity, which was considered to be a moon shot for AI, does not seem to be too far any more. Is that true? Are we close to see creative AI? The answer is yes and no. We are moving closer with meaningful developments in Machine Learning, however there are several questions to be explored further to achieve the creative AI. What kind of creativity we want to represent? How do we translate creativity into what machines can understand? How do we design ML algorithms to be more creative? This course is where we explore these questions through seminars and projects. Our goal is to design computational models that present the very possibility of the creative AI. The instructors who are specialized in Machine Learning Art and Robotics lead this course together. We introduce related examples and possible methods including multi-modal data-driven learning, learning from demonstration, and combined learning from data and human demonstrations. Students are welcome to bring in their expertise and passion from diverse backgrounds to explore this topic together.

The course will also provide a methodological framework for designing and evaluating existing evaluation metrics, methods, and approaches. We formalize the necessary characteristics of evaluation benchmarks and automated methods to ensure that they capture the benefits and risks of GenAI systems in deployment. We focus on four key criteria: Validity, Reliability, Feasibility, and Usability. Through course projects, students will be prompted to design and/evaluate methods for evaluating the risks and capabilities of GenAI applications.",

Not all of these were initially published in the ML/AI literature (eg: Bellman in math, VC in probability, bandits in statistics, fuzzy sets in control, optimization work in OR, etc, but now play central roles in ML and/or AI). Since \"historical\" is always ambiguous, we're going to go with \"presented/published before the instructor was born\" as a definition (pre-1988). While the content of the paper will be the primary focus, we will also attempt to understand the research context in which the paper was written. For example, what questions were other researchers asking at the time? Was the paper immediately recognized as a breakthrough or did it take a long time? Do we view the contents of the paper today as \"obvious in hindsight\" or is there still a lot of material in the paper that is nontrivial and even surprising or underappreciated? Who was the author, were they already relatively well known when they wrote the paper, or was it the paper itself that made them famous? What else did these authors work on before/after the paper?",

They are difficult to visualize and introduce computational, storage, and communication bottlenecks during data preprocessing and model training. Moreover, high capacity models often used in conjunction with large datasets introduce additional computational and storage hurdles during model training and inference. This course is intended to provide a student with the mathematical, algorithmic, and practical knowledge of issues involving learning with large datasets. Among the topics considered are: data cleaning, visualization, and pre-processing at scale; principles of parallel and distributed computing for machine learning; techniques for scalable deep learning; analysis of programs in terms of memory, computation, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity; and methods for low-latency inference. The class will include programming and written assignments to provide hands-on experience applying machine learning at scale.

The course will start by providing a basic arsenal of useful statistical and computational tools, including generalization guarantees, core algorithmic methods, and fundamental analysis models. We will examine questions such as: Under what conditions can we hope to meaningfully generalize from limited data? How can we best combine different kinds of information such as labeled and unlabeled data, leverage multiple related learning tasks, or leverage multiple types of features? What can we prove about methods for summarizing and making sense of massive datasets, especially under limited memory? We will also examine other important constraints and resources in data science including privacy, communication, and taking advantage of limited interaction. In addressing these and related questions we will make connections to statistics, algorithms, linear algebra, complexity theory, information theory, optimization, game theory, and empirical machine learning research. Topics to be covered will include: - Fundamental measures of complexity for generalization, including VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity. - Core algorithmic tools including boosting, regularization, and online optimization with connections to game theory. - Spectral methods, streaming algorithms and other approaches for handling massive data. - Foundations and algorithms for addressing important constraints or externalities such as privacy, limited memory, and communication constraints. - Foundations for modern learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, never-ending learning, interactive learning, and deep learning.

In the past few years, researchers across many different communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep (hierarchical) models and #8212; models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception. This is an advanced graduate course, designed for Master's and Ph.D. level students, and will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the recent and exciting developments of various deep learning methods. Some topics to be covered include: restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their multi-layer extensions Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann machines; sparse coding, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and attention-based models with applications in vision, NLP, and multimodal learning.

Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human? The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society. Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question. This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age. We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines. We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.

    "description": "This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars. The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started. Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward. However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need? This kernel and #8212; extracted from the \"big plan\" and #8212; is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity. These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies. In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market. The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business. In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business. To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world. The course is project based. Each student will either build their own business concept, or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business. Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.

In the vast majority of cases the same cannot be said for robots. In fact, many conventional approaches to motion planning and robot control attempt to explicitly cancel out the dynamics associated with different tasks. This class will consider underactuated robots, systems that do not have full control over their state and therefore cannot be planned for or controlled via conventional methods. Our goal will be to make novel locomoting robots act more \"naturally.\" This class will highlight the relationship between conventional ideas from deterministic motion planning and control design (e.g., dynamic programming and linear-quadratic regulators) and their contemporary counterparts, many of which help form the analytical basis for the probabilisitic reasoning that underlies contemporary AI systems (e.g., POMDPs). Note that this course is inspired by and, for the most part, will follow the format of \"Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines\" created by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT.

Some experts believe it is only a matter of time until enough training data is available for robots to achieve a similar kind of breakthrough observed in language models, while others argue there are critical challenges that data alone would not be able to address, e.g., dexterity, safety, and social intelligence. In this course, we study how we can address those challenges related to robot intelligence. This course covers interdisciplinary topics on cognitive intelligence in robotic systems. Cognitive abilities constitute high-level, humanlike intelligence that exhibits reasoning or problem-solving skills. Such abilities as semantic perception, use of language, and task planning can be built on top of low-level robot autonomy. The topics covered may bridge multiple technical areas, for example, vision-language intersection and language-action/plan grounding. Project Themes Filmmaking presents varied robotics and machine learning challenges ranging from content generation, e.g. scenario generation or scene/video synthesis/editing to robotics automation, e.g. autonomous camera control or autonomous stop-motion control. Arts in Robotics is a fast growing field that connects robotics with humanity such as creativity and compassion. Sample projects include robot painting, robot sculpting, pottery making, etc. Following natural language instructions in navigation or manipulation tasks remain difficult despite the powerful foundation models. This theme encourages the students to design an innovative intelligent architecture that can be a game changer in this fast moving field. The projects on social robots will explore how robots can recognize and understand human emotions or social norms to choose suitable actions/behaviors in various social contexts.

Robust and scalable solutions are needed that can handle the uncertainty inherent in sensor measurements, while providing localization and map estimates in real-time. We will explore suitable efficient probabilistic inference algorithms at the intersection of linear algebra and probabilistic graphical models. We will also explore state-of-the-art systems.

Insects can perform different tasks, such as manipulation or locomotion, with their small scale bodies varying from 200m to 16cm length. Similarly, we can define a micro-robotic system as an autonomous or semi-autonomous device with features on the micron scale or that make use of micron-scale physics for mobility or manipulation of objects. Due to their small size scales, microrobots will encounter difficulties unlike their macro-scale counterparts, in terms of fabrication and autonomy. In this project-based course, our aim will be on learning the physics of scaling, fabrication paradigms, actuation and sensing strategies, with numerous case studies, and to build an insect-inspired robotic system. We will also discuss multiple applications such as surgical robotics, mobile microrobots, multi-agent systems, and micro/nano manipulation.",

    "description": "Research related to hands has increased dramatically over the past decade. Robot hand innovation may be at an all time high, with new materials and manufacturing techniques promoting an explosion of ideas. Hands have become a priority in virtual reality and telepresence. Even the study of how people use their hands is seeing the growth of new ideas and themes. With all of this attention on hands, are we close to a breakthrough in dexterity, or are we still missing some things needed for truly dexterous manipulation? In this course, we will survey robotic hands and learn about the human hand with the goal of pushing the frontiers on hand design and control for dexterous manipulation. We will consider the necessary kinematics and dynamics for dexterity, what sensors are required to carry out dexterous interactions, the importance of reflexes and compliance, the role of machine learning in grasping and manipulation, and the challenge of uncertainty. We will explore state of the art manufacturing and design techniques, including innovations in soft robotics and embedded sensing. We will examine the human hand: its structure, sensing capabilities, human grasp choice and control strategies for inspiration and benchmarking. Students will be asked to present one or two research papers, participate in discussions and short research or design exercises, and carry out a final project.

This is a seminar course in which we read papers related to deep learning for robotics and analyze the tradeoffs between different approaches. We will read mostly state-of-the-art papers that were very recently published (e.g. recent CoRL, RSS), but we will also look at some older papers that use different approaches. The goals of the course are to 1) understand what is needed to make deep learning work for robotics 2) analyze the tradeoffs between different approaches. Each class, 2 papers will be presented. These papers will both achieve a similar robotics task but will use different learning-based approaches. The class will discuss these papers and try to understand the strengths and limitations of the approach described in each paper.

    "description": "Safe autonomy has become increasingly critical in many application domains. It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot, but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the autonomy. For example, robots should be safe to human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly; autonomous vehicles should be safe to other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct functioning of all system components, i.e., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control. This course deals with both the design and the verification of safe robotic systems. From the design perspective, we will talk about how to assure safety through planning, prediction, learning, and control. From the verification perspective, we will talk about verification of deep neural networks, safety or reachability analysis for closed loop systems, and analysis of multi-agent systems.

The course material should be a self-contained collection of key topics from the intersection of four research areas geared towards this common goal: a) Robot Learning and amp; Deep RL; (b) Computer Vision; (c) Control; (d) Psychology and amp; Neuroscience. This course is geared mainly towards learning and brainstorming. There will be two classes every week. In this first class, instructor will present an in-depth overview of a topic, and then in the second class, students will present instructor-assigned papers related to that topic. There will be no homeworks and just a course project. In the first quarter, we will cover state-of-the-art topics in robot learning (deep RL, inverse RL, etc.) and control (optimal control, dynamic movement primitives, etc.) by studying classical and recent papers in the area. In the second quarter, we will study the role of perception in control and vice-versa to build methods that can learn from high-dimensional raw sensory input. In the third quarter, we will discuss the state of the current understanding of how the brain integrates action and perception. We will also discuss relevant papers from ontogeny (child development literature in Psychology) and phylogeny (evolutionary development literature in Biology) of biological animals that have inspired ideas in learning and robotics. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will bring these ideas together to brainstorm potential high-level directions that could guide the development of intelligent robots.",

    "description": "Safety is a nuanced concept. For embodied systems, like robots, we commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance. But out in the \"open world\" it can be much more: for example, a safe mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task and understand that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached. In this class, we study the question of if (and how) the rise of modern artificial intelligence (AI) models (e.g., deep neural trajectory predictors, large vision-language models, and latent world models) can be harnessed to unlock new avenues for generalizing safety to the open world. From a foundations perspective, we study safety methods from two complementary communities: control theory (which enables the computation of safe decisions) and machine learning (which enables uncertainty quantification and anomaly detection). Throughout the class, there will also be several guest lectures from experts in the field. Students will practice essential research skills including reviewing papers, writing project proposals, and technical communication.

    "description": "Climate change is considered by many the most serious social, political, and environmental issue of the 21st century. As human activities increase the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, scientists have established the reality of climate change and have estimated its impacts on human society and the natural world. Despite the scientific consensus on its existence, causes, and consequences, a substantial number of Americans and citizens of other countries still question these conclusions and a small but vocal group of doubters continue to challenge the science and scientific consensus on climate change. In spite of some social division over these issues, governments at local, national, and international levels have made concerted efforts to craft policies to address climate change. These policies have shifted over time as the information, attitudes, and technology associated with climate change have evolved. In this course, we will explore the challenges and complexities of climate change by investigating the subject from a variety of angles: scientific, political, rhetorical, cultural, economic, technological, and ethical. Over the course of the semester, well inquire: What is climate change? How do scientists know it is happening? Why is there public debate over it? What solutions are available? And what are the pros and cons of the different solutions?",

    "description": "This course will develop the understanding required for materials science and engineering for additive manufacturing. The emphasis will be on powder bed machines for printing metal parts, reflecting the research emphasis at CMU. The full scope of methods in use, however, will also be covered. The topics are intended to enable students to understand which materials are feasible for 3D printing. Accordingly, high power density welding methods such as electron beam and laser welding will be discussed, along with the characteristic defects. Since metal powders are a key input, powder-making methods will be discussed. Components once printed must satisfy various property requirements hence microstructure-property relationships will be discussed because the microstructures that emerge from the inherently high cooling rates differ strongly from conventional materials. Defect structures are important to performance and therefore inspection. Porosity is a particularly important feature of 3D printed metals and its occurrence depends strongly on the input materials and on the processing conditions. The impact of data science on this area offers many possibilities such as the automatic recognition of materials origin and history. Finally the context for the course will be discussed, i.e. the rapidly growing penetration of the technology and its anticipated impact on manufacturing.",

The obsession with outer space is found among scientists, business people and politicians, in deed and story, in film and even computer games. If we are to fully appreciate the potentials of space, we must also consider the search for intelligent life in its scientific and societal aspects, and investigate how we could adapt our systems of communication to reach species across distances that may be physically insurmountable. This interdisciplinary course will be taught by scholars from distinct cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Course materials will be taken from scientific literature, the history of science, and science fiction. We will explore scientific writing and reasoning, the space race between global powers, space travel and colonization, and the promise and pitfalls of interspecies and interspace communication. A planetary perspective, once achieved, can change the way one sees other inhabitants of this planet - as partners in survival in a universe which sets enormous odds against it, or as unwelcome intruders grasping for scant resources within this thin epidermis of soil, air, and water which surrounds Earth and makes our lives possible.",

    "description": "Art and Science and #8212; two fields of study that are most often considered diametrically opposed. Art is frivolous entertainment. Science is hard rational fact. In this Grand Challenge course, we hope to break that supposition or at least examine it in great detail. Specifically, we will use theater to argue that drama can produce challenging, demanding and intelligent work that showcases the impact of science on current discourse. We want to link the two cultures. The word \"theater\" has the same etymological root as \"theory\" - both words come from the Greek thea meaning view. This shared origin demonstrates ways we can work to analyze and interpret both fields and show the common ground between these two cultures. As we attend to plays and writing ranging from Tom Stoppards Arcadia and Michael Frayns Copenhagen to Caryl Churchills A Number and Oliver Sacks Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat, our class discussions will consider questions that include: Why is science a trend in contemporary theater? Does it reflect on our dependence on technology? What kinds of questions are being asked when science or scientific theory is presented on the stage? Are people attracted to plays about science because of their difficult subject matter or does it does it lack the engagement of popular culture? In addition to integrating humanities and scientific approaches within Dietrich College, this course will utilize the expertise of both individuals in the School of Drama and the producers in the local theater community, and local science writers. Finally, in addition to weekly writing assignments, the course will ask students to produce original dramatic scenes that incorporate scientific exploration which will, ultimately, lead to staged readings of their work.",

The course uses a multi-disciplinary approach, examining the topic from several different perspectives. We'll investigate social movements to expand the vote, the role of technology, game theory, polling, predictions, electoral mapping, social media, the structures of American governance, and more. Questions include: What is the electoral college? Who gets to vote and why? How well is that vote accounted for? How can voting systems be compromised? Why is it so hard to predict who will win? How do people make decisions? How useful are polling and amp; predictions? What disrupts voting? Why is turnout so low? How does money play a role in the election cycle? Why do we vote the way we do? How is social media changing elections? What are global best practices? Did the founders even intend for a mass democracy? (The answer is no!) Many of you will be first-time, eligible voters in one of the most remarkable presidential campaigns in American history. We'll build your skills as new democratic citizens, of this nation or others, and help you make sense of the history-making U.S. news cycle.

How does environmentalism connect to struggles over social justice and human rights? This first-year interdisciplinary seminar is an introduction to the Grand Challenge: Environmental Justice. In Giovanna de Chiro's words, the environmental justice movement is working \"toward building diverse, dynamic, and powerful coalitions to address the world's most pressing social and environmental crises global poverty and global climate change by organizing across scales and 'seeking a global vision' for healthy, resilient, and sustainable communities.\" In this seminar, we'll study the history and science behind two interconnected challenges for environmental justice: global climate change and fine-particulate air pollution. Both types of pollution start with combustion of fossil fuels. Particulate air pollution kills roughly 7 million globally each year; these air pollution deaths happen close to the source, with unequal levels of exposure and risk for people according to class and race. Climate change, mostly from carbon dioxide and methane emissions, is spread globally and lasts well beyond our lifetimes, yet the effects are again disproportionately based on class and race. In this course, we'll explore the science, history, ethics, and public perception of these problems, with implications for Pittsburgh and the planet, and for the near- and long-term future.",

In this course, students and faculty together will seek to achieve two main objectives: (1) examine ways in which cultural and societal values are reflected in sports and (2) how Virtual Reality (VR) technology can help design experiences that enhance the users' awareness of these issues by engaging with these cultural and societal perspectives. Within project teams, we will first unpack sports stories that are squarely situated at the crossroads of sports and culture(s). Then we will explore the role of VR technology to help craft these narratives. In doing so, students will discover what it means to write stories for VR experiences.

How did they survive, adapt to, and resist the conquest and colonization of their lands, and ensuing social and cultural dislocations? How have they resurged politically, culturally, artistically and intellectually in recent years? This course considers the history, experiences, and perspectives of native populations across the Americas. It seeks to reckon with the facts of the Native American experience, while challenging the fictions of stereotypes and narratives that have often relegated Indigenous people to the social and cultural margins of the nations in which they now live. After introducing students to a few of the myriad Indigenous groups of North, Central and South America, we will then survey the implications of the era of European conquest and colonization. Well consider the implications of the rise of new nations in the Americas, as new and intensifying campaigns of violence were unleashed against Indigenous populations. We will consider the rise of Native American civil rights and political and cultural sovereignty movements from the late 20th century forward, as they coalesced into major political challenges to native marginalization and demands for recognition and reparation of historical injustices. Finally, we will explore how contemporary Indigenous artists, authors, and political and social activists are reimagining indigeneity (the condition and experience of being Indigenous) in ways that demonstrate how indigeneity is not a fixed kind of identity, not one that is confined or defined in any way by a static conception of tradition, but rather one that challenges the present and reimagines the future in dynamic and creative ways.",

In this course, we define resilience as an intersectional capacity of individuals, communities, and systems to adapt, recover, and grow in response to adversity, disruption, or change—drawing on psychological, social, ecological, and artistic resources to sustain well-being and support transformation. We'll explore these layers through the lens of graphic storytelling, using comics and visual narratives to examine stories of wellness, identity, trauma, and individual/ collective recovery across cultural contexts. Drawing from works originally written in English or Spanish (all readings available in English), we'll explore how artists use color, composition, symbolism, and visual form to surface what is often left unsaid in conversations about health and healing. Students will analyze how visual techniques express resilience across race, geography, and sociocultural systems—and will experiment to create their own graphic narratives using comic-making tools and artistic strategies. Emphasis will be placed on storytelling as both personal reflection and public advocacy. The course includes hands-on projects and community-facing components: students will collaborate to design community-engaged projects—such as school visits, public showcases, or partnerships with local organizations—to share and expand the impact of their work.

This course is designed to critically examine the social factors research has found to impact individual and population health experiences. This course will introduce students to the multiple approaches to researching the complex problem of health disparities in the United States with particular emphasis on perspectives from the social sciences and humanities. Specifically, students will examine how factors such as socioeconomic status, education, crime, housing, health care and food availability play important roles in the production of disparate health. Students will examine psychological factors that can create disparate health experiences and the impact of such disparities on psychological health. We will address health disparities at the individual and population levels, learning how disparate health experiences are historically and socially produced, and how such disparities produce negative physical and mental health outcomes for individuals and minoritized populations. At the end of the course, students will present a collaborative group project that examines a specific facet of US health disparities and offer a proposed solution. Using a multi- disciplinary perspective, we will challenge students to discover just how important seemly unimportant interpersonal and structural factors can be in explaining health disparities and how important it is for society to take measures to address these disparities.",

This course will address themes and questions such as: - American exceptionalism: Does violence play an extraordinary role in American and culture, in contrast to other nations? What are its historical antecedents? - The escalation of violence in American political culture: Why does political polarization engender violence? Do traditional appeals to \"freedom\" accelerate such violence? - How has America become a country of prisons and mass incarceration? - Global impacts: How does the U.S.'s militarized political culture impact nations and people beyond its borders?",

    "description": "Learning to reduce conflict requires understanding positionality and identities, and why and how societies build barriers in their populations. In this interdisciplinary course, students will learn how to talk to each other and strangers about identity: its defining characteristics and how our bias influences our judgments. The social sciences elements will stress Social Identity Theory, bias, stereotypes, and in-groups and out-groups. The humanities elements will include close-reading strategies and incorporate conceptual frameworks from cultural studies, literary studies, and narrative theory. In addition to practicing the methodologies in these two disciplines, students will undertake two projects. In the first project, they will develop and implement a semi-structured interview protocol for their campus peers centered around belonging. In the second project, students will employ close reading techniques to analyze Young Adult novels that address complex questions of identity, isolation, bias, and rejection. Working with one novel and Project 1 data, each team of social sciences, humanities, and data specialists will create a website to highlight inclusive successes and challenges. This final cohesive 'picture' of themes pertaining to feelings of belonging on our campus will help guide the CMU community toward deeper understanding and acceptance practices.",

    "description": "Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action have reignited the debate about equitable access to higher education. Affirmative action has been challenged many times, which highlights the complex nature of providing equitable access to higher education in a society that is not \"equal\" on many measures. Students from historically marginalized communities are often at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing higher education. Even those who are admitted to college may not have the tools or resources to succeed. Throughout its history, and especially since the 1960s, Carnegie Mellon has undertaken multiple initiatives to provide equitable education to underserved populations. This course explores these initiatives, both past and present, as well as the broader debates about affirmative action. As a highly selective institution, CMU serves as an important case study for exploring the challenges and opportunities for achieving equitable access and success in higher education. This course will focus on two CMU programs aimed to address the problem of inequitable education, namely SCOPP and CMAP/CMARC. We will draw on primary sources from the CMU Archives and students will be asked to analyze these sources using historical and linguistic approaches. We are interested in exploring how the language used in discussions of affirmative action and student identities changes over time and in response to different historical factors. Students will collaboratively engage with primary source material to develop a final creative project that considers the history of various affirmative action initiatives at CMU and makes connections between these earlier efforts and today's programs. Class meetings will consist of group discussion and small activities as well as guest speakers. Outside of class, students will complete readings, written assignments, reflections, and a collaborative project.",

By exploring actual and hypothetical cases, students will analyze the complex dilemmas that arise when we try to balance two interests: maximizing freedom of expression and creating an inclusive, respectful community. By engaging a wide range of disciplinary perspectives and methods of inquiry from philosophy, history, psychology, law, etc., students will examine how different policies and norms impact these competing interests and vice versa. Students will practice informed and constructive dialogue within the seminar to facilitate independent thought, rigorous inquiry, and how to discuss difficult topics productively. Course topics will include: - the rights and responsibilities involved in FOS for both individuals and institutions, - the history and current state of the law with respect to FOS, - the history and state of university policies and practices about AF for research and education, including scholarship, artistic freedom, teaching, in particular trigger warnings, safe spaces, censorship, protest, and controversial outside speakers, - developmental perspectives on how children learn about freedom of expression, - FOS in advertising, media, and social media, including recommendation algorithms.

However, this information flow is increasingly shaped by algorithms and artificial intelligence, influencing how we perceive and interpret it. This Grand Challenge course will examine the complexities of living in a world of information overload, especially when much of it is algorithmically delivered. Integrating the perspectives of computer science, cognitive science, neuroscience and philosophy, we will explore the nature of information, its structure, and the connection between information and meaning. We will then shift to studying the process of learning, focusing on its core principles and how human learning interacts with the information we encounter to shape our knowledge and understanding. We will also delve into how this capacity can become biased, making us overly sensitive to certain information while ignoring or overlooking other types. In this course, we will analyze these biases and their impact on our behavior, both positively and negatively. We will also explore how algorithms filter information for us (e.g., social media) or even create it (e.g., ChatGPT) and the effects of this filtering on knowledge and comprehension. The class will be hands-on with technology, experimenting with different AI tools to enhance the learning experience, while also developing the skills to collaborate with peers in productive discussions around these complex issues.",

We will focus on how human rights frameworks can be used to make the world more just, equitable, and free. We will begin by discussing the theoretical foundations of human rights and the development of human rights institutions in the 20th century. Students will learn how rights have been constructed through legal action, activism, and treaty negotiations in the past and examine the emergence and contestation of new rights today. We will explore why particular rights frameworks are privileged in some societies but not others. We will then focus on how practitioners investigate and document potential rights violations around the world, including in our own backyard. The instructors bring disciplinary expertise in history, journalism, and data analysis, and the course will feature guest lectures by legal experts and human rights practitioners. Topics covered will include genocide and other war crimes; political repression; economic, social, and cultural rights; environmental rights; migration and refugees; gender identity and sexuality; and indigenous rights. By the end of semester, students will be prepared to propose an action plan to address a specific human rights challenge in a community that they are familiar with. In previous semesters, our students have worked on projects related to deaths in Pennsylvania's jails and prisons in partnership with local organizations, proposed a project to assess human rights violations of migrants at the US/Mexico border, and conducted an international open source investigation of human rights violations using online media and satellite imagery.",

Large numbers of people are forced from home for political, personal, or racial reasons, and many others leave home because of grinding poverty and need. Conflicts about the mass migration provoked by this crisis have emerged all over the globe, from the United States, Latin America, and Europe, to Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and even Oceania. Writers, filmmakers, and artists have attempted to address the plight of refugees and migrants in their works, and many writers, filmmakers, and other artists are themselves refugees or migrants. Pittsburgh has a unique institution, City of Asylum, whose mission is to assist and advocate for persecuted writers and other artists. It hosts the largest residency program in the world for writers living in exile under threat of persecution or worse: death. The goal of this Grand Challenge Seminar is (1) to familiarize students with todays plight of refugees (e.g., social, political, economic factors; cross-cultural comparisons; dynamics of class, race, gender, and nationality), and (2) introduce them to a variety of textual (literary and theoretical) and visual materials and to the resources available through City of Asylum. Through readings, discussions, guest speakers, short papers, and group film projects/presentations, students will examine the ways in which writers, filmmakers, musicians, and other artists have addressed exile and migration in their work by constructing, revising, and reinventing images and cultures of the homeland. Students will explore a variety of texts (e.g., films, documentaries, art, music, photography; prose, poems, and presentations by exiled artists; archival materials; news reports, articles) and meet with and interview exiled writers and other artists.",

This course will examine the political, literary, economic, and historical narratives that surround the region, as well as examining the role that Appalachia can play as a model for developing regions in other parts of the world. The paradoxes of Appalachia have confronted American culture since its first settlement by Europeans in the 18th century: a region of unparalleled biodiversity, it has nevertheless been characterized by ongoing poverty and isolation. Politically, it has given rise to both progressive collective action and conservative rhetoric. Economically, its natural resources have been widely exploited by outside economic and industrial interests. Its inhabitants have been characterized as either fiercely independent or widely dysfunctional, giving rise to the archetypes of Mountaineers, Rednecks, or Hillbillies. Its cultural ethos has resisted ready inclusion into mainstream culture. This course will examine these paradoxes by utilizing history, literature, and public policy documents that detail the ongoing debates surrounding Appalachian development, while consulting with several invited writers, political figures, and artists who have interpreted the regions role in American history.",

We will explore the various disciplinary perspectives on research validity, and compare and contrast these with public perspectives on research validity. Along the way, students will be introduced to evidence synthesis methodology, a broad research approach that allows researchers to assess large bodies of literature and find points of consensus in any topic area such as climate change, vaccines, economic inequality, etc. Students will work in teams to formulate their research questions on a topic of their selection and then conduct evidence synthesis projects related to (mis)trust in that research area.

Access to environmental \"justice,\" that is, the right to a healthy environment, is linked to social factors like race, ethnicity, indigenous identity, income, educational status, and geographic location, among others. By analyzing the case of Pittsburgh, a city in the rust belt and Appalachian region that is working to \"reimagine\" its environmental identity, students will trace past environmental issues and define current environmental concerns that may manifest both locally and globally. They will use environmental justice as a framework to examine how environmental issues are defined and how policies are created and enacted when different voices are included. Students will explore these topics as they relate to multiple sectors (e.g., air and water quality, agriculture, industry, transportation, architecture) and environmental impacts like human physical and mental health or global climate change. Students will also be introduced to concepts like \"sustainable science\" and \"sustainable humanities,\" and study how environmental problems and solutions are framed in different cultures, communities, and academic disciplines ranging from science to social science and art.",

Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain. This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights. The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the \"free speech\" amendment to the Constitution. This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances. This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.",

During times of conflict and internecine warfare, it is essential to preserve objects of historical and cultural heritage. Blockchain is a block of data chained together. It does three noteworthy things: 1. digitization, 2. tracing, and 3. security. For any non-digital historical data, Blockchain can provide digitization. For any data that requires tracing, such as scientific findings, religious information, or scriptures (including Hadith/sayings of the Prophet (s)), so on, tracing can play a pivotal role in going back to the originator and understanding the change on the way, as well as preserving it from any changes (which is part of security). Blockchain also involves a mining process, which includes stakeholders that audit the information of any newly added block of data, making Blockchain auditable, which is significant for history. Using topics from blockchain technology, history, preservation, and science, this course provides students with the grand challenge of understanding how bitcoin and cryptocurrency can assist in providing potential solutions to the problems of authorship, impermanence, managing shared ownership, and stewardship of artifacts taken through war or colonialism. Many institutions and archives are considering and advocating the merits of blockchain-based repositories. In this Grand Challenge course, we want to examine how the seemingly opposed fields of study - history and blockchain technology - can be synergized to create a futuristic museum that captures monuments and artifacts, making them accessible to future generations.",

In the weeks leading up to the trip, the professors will introduce students to the history, literature, film, and language(s) of the region, as well as to critical scholarship in food studies. Students will also begin developing and creating their own personal narrative experience in the media of their choice. During the trip, students will participate in documenting local food cultures through film and other media. Upon their return, they will work on the production of a collaborative multi-layered interactive documentary (iDoc) meant to capture their first-hand experiences with local and regional cuisine practices in Israel and the West Bank, and present separate small group final projects based on these experiences. Specific course themes will include: the shared history of Arabs and Jews from the rise of Islam to Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) and the Ottoman Empire to the modern and contemporary history of the Arab-Israeli conflict; the history of Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Mizrahi Jewish immigration and contributions to Israeli cuisine; Palestinian identity, culinary traditions and gendered aspects of food practices; the politics of food; and Palestinian and Jewish voices in literary contexts.

As part of this endeavor, students take part in informed discussions about interpretive lenses; ways of seeing; and thinking about social, cultural, and historical contexts for interpretations of environment and sustainability. This seminar-style course introduces key methods and approaches for interdisciplinary inquiry within a framework of Environmental Humanities and Environmental Justice. Scholar Giovanna de Chiro writes: \"The term 'environmental justice' emerged from the activism of communities of color in the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century...They advocate for social policies that uphold the right to meaningful, democratic participation of frontline communities in environmental decision making.\" The implications of disciplinary narratives and approaches to questions of environment and sustainability, and the implications for social justice, are a key and repeated question in the course. The role of poverty as a cultural, political, and historical phenomenon is a motif in many of our discussions. We'll explore contrasting historical, cultural, and disciplinary explanations for hunger, famine, and food insecurity. Further, we'll explore how so-called \"environmental\" explanations for food scarcity, which rationalize the persistence of hunger and poverty in the 21st century, have distracted from decades of expertise, reminding us that hunger and poverty are social problems. In contrast to these so-called \"environmental\" explanations, there is no scarcity of food in the present era.

    "description": "The purpose of this course is to provide students admitted to the Dietrich College Senior Honors Program with a shared set of intellectual and practical sessions that will enhance their senior honors thesis experience. The course will consist of seven bi-weekly 80-minute meetings. Each will be organized around a theme and related topics that are relevant to the senior honors thesis experience, and that take advantage of both the high caliber and interdisciplinary diversity of the course members. Guest visitors will also be a common feature of the course. Topics could include: the meaning(s) of \"honors;\" getting started and keeping pace: the ebb and flow of an independent research project (including how to recognize and avoid procrastination; forging a successful relationship with your thesis advisor - the myth of the separation of research from writing; writing for publication); ethics in research; \"interdisciplinarity,\" or the \"unity of knowledge;\" funding for research; preparing for and delivering effective presentations; intellectual property rights, and human subjects policy. Guest speakers invited to address and engage class members in discussion/debate of topics that lend themselves to interdisciplinary discussion and debate (e.g., stem cell research, which calls into play science, ethics, etc.). Course requirements will include mandatory attendance, occasional readings (where appropriate), acting as co-leader for at least one session, and - at course's end - (a) a written, formal preliminary thesis statement and action plan, endorsed by the thesis advisor, and tentatively, (b) a brief oral presentation of the thesis statement and plan to the class + thesis advisors during the last class meeting. All students will participate in critiques of fellow-students' presentations and plans.",

Health and illness are key drivers of the human experience. And yet, health is fundamentally impacted by different human experiences. This first year Grand Challenges seminar will introduce students to core concepts in the life sciences that will enable them to better appreciate the scientific aspects of health. Building on this knowledge, students will then explore important psychosocial determinants, ethical constraints, and historical roots of health. Students will also develop a familiarity with the cultural and communicative skills required to argue about health, make decisions, and engage empathically with others in their health stories. We will read and discuss a broad variety of materials from medical science articles to social psychological experimental reports and personal or literary narratives about health. The course is divided into three components: health and preventative behaviors; coping with disruptive health experiences; managing chronic health challenges. We will provide a broad overview for each category, followed by a deep dive focused on particular health issues: diet and exercise (prevention); anxiety and depression (management); epidemics/Covid-19/cancer (disruption). Given the broad array of topics discussed, we believe these components can engage students on a personal level.",

    "description": "This interdisciplinary course explores the entangled relationship between architecture and the arts, and their struggle between autonomy and engagement. It will be structured around a series of themes, drawings, and writings that reveal architecture's constantly changing involvement with art, culture, society, and related disciplines The course functions both an introduction to Architecture as Art for a general audience, as well as a critical introduction to architectural thinking and theory for architecture majors. The course will include slide lectures, readings, reading reports, discussions, and a series of research exercises to engage architecture and art more critically, and an exam. We'll examine the common roots, disparate characters, and inter-twined histories of architecture and the arts. We'll investigate not just buildings and art works, but ideas, drawings, images and other representations involved in the construction and reception of architecture that often relate closely to the arts. We'll look at shared terms like composition, rhythm, studio, and form. We'll define architecture in relation to categories such as fine and applied arts, high and low arts, visual and performing arts, and relate these to broad categories such as design, visual culture, and the liberal arts. We'll ask \"why\" we make architecture and art, rather than \"how,\" and discuss how the human need for expression and meaning can augment the technical and constructed value of mere making or building. We'll debate how the discipline of architecture has been, and can continue to be framed as a fine art, but also act as a service profession, a political tool, a technical expertise, a research endeavor, or as a mode of cultural discourse.",

The course is divided into two topics with one assignment each: Technical Drawing and 2D Graphics. Students are required to submit work at the end of each class, in addition to self-guided work outside of class times: satisfactory completions of the two assignments, specific Lynda tutorials, final project, and final portfolio are required for the successful completion of the course. Through these deliverables, the course will inquire issues of 2D representation as it pertains to the effective communication of technical and conceptual information in spatial design processes. With digital media, designers now have an arsenal of tools that can subvert and augment traditional means of representation with exponentially greater fidelity and efficiency. Students will have an opportunity to practice these values and favor hybrid approaches that strive to blur the boundaries of analog and digital media, so as to learn how to be versatile in leveraging all forms of media for the design task at hand.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles \"Teenie\" Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences.",

Arguably, the better a consultant you are, the better a communicator you are, and the best communicators tend to make very good consultants (nice symmetry there). Poor communication and other 'soft skills' can derail a consulting engagement and with it, a promising consulting career. As an example, a Gartner Group study found that 80% of all IT projects were late, over budget, or failed completely because of poor communication at the outset. This course will help students interested in a consulting career acquire new skills in everything from personal branding to asking high-value, incisive questions to building strong, long-term client relationships",

The explosive advances in information technology combined with the current challenges facing healthcare delivery have created the need for skilled individuals who can develop, understand, manage, and integrate healthcare information systems in organizations. This course will explore the concepts and application of major information systems methodologies and approaches in the delivery of modern healthcare systems, including traditional face-to-face, online, and mobile and social media enabled care delivery. A semester-long group project that synthesizes the different topics via the design and implementation of a working, integrated, healthcare decision support application will be a required component of the course. Data are everywhere. For policy makers, the ability to tell the right story using data can make the difference between a successful initiative and one that fails. Part art, part science, visualizing data is a process that is both well established in existing disciplines and experimental and rapidly changing in others. In this course well explore both ends of the spectrum as we deconstruct and reconstruct data visualizations behind some of the worlds most powerful brands, dig into our own data in compelling ways to help our readers understand complex issues, and finally experiment with new ways to represent data about our work, our community, and even ourselves. This course will provide hands-on training and experimentation with a number of tools, and students will have some flexibility to concentrate on mediums that best match their desired outcomes for a final project deliverable (print, digital, interactive or immersive). By the end of this course, students will have an introduction to a number of different tools and techniques that will allow them to immediately start applying what theyve learned to both other coursework as well as on-the-job needs.",

How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as \"unstructured\". This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach: We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. There is a final project in this course which must address a policy question. How this course differs from 95-865 \"Unstructured Data Analysis\": 95-865 emphasizes more of the technical skill development (assessed through two in-class exams involving coding), and does not have any sort of policy focus. 94-775 has a policy-focused final project instead of a final exam. 94-775 does not require cloud computing (part of 95-865 requires the use of Amazon Web Services).

It is in contrast to a one-size-fits-all approach, in which disease treatment and prevention strategies are developed for the average person, with less consideration for the differences between individuals. Advances in precision medicine have already led to powerful new discoveries and several new treatments that are tailored to specific characteristics, such as a person's genetic makeup. With advances in technology, it is becoming possible to use the most unique of characteristics - our genomes - to tailor treatments for individuals. Genomes are made up of a complete set of our DNA, including all of our genes, and are the instruction manual on how to build and maintain the 37 trillion cells in our bodies. Any two people share more than 99% of their DNA. It's the remaining less than 1% that makes us unique, and can affect the severity of a disease and effectiveness of treatments.

The explosive advances in information technology combined with the current challenges facing healthcare delivery have created the need for skilled individuals who can develop, understand, manage, and integrate healthcare information systems in organizations. This course will explore the concepts and application of major information systems methodologies and approaches in the delivery of modern healthcare systems, including traditional face-to-face, online, and mobile and social media enabled care delivery. A semester-long group project that synthesizes the different topics via the design and implementation of a working, integrated, healthcare decision support application will be a required component of the course.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, psychological, ethical, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and function in the digital age. The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive. Is there a \"sweet\" spot that satisfies the interests of all parties? Is there a combination of technological solutions, economic incentives, and legal safeguards that is acceptable for the individual and beneficial to society? This course tries to address the above questions.

    "description": "The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means. Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice. Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skillattributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training. An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected. This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies.

    "description": "It is a societal imperative that we improve the quality of health for all Americans while reducing the cost. In so doing, we must move from a reactionary, disease driven, hospital-dominated model to one that creates the appropriate level of incentives and health delivery infrastructure so that patients embrace strategies to prevent disease and promote healthy living and behavior. What is Population Health and what role do individuals, executive branch agencies, and non-profits play in the protection and promotion of positive health outcomes? How are health outcomes assessed? In this introductory course, we will examine the way health care delivery systems, public health agencies, community-based organizations, and many other entities work together to develop interventions to improve the health outcomes in the local, national, and global communities they serve. We will first learn to examine health issues from a population health perspective.",

A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, environmental health, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It involves learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps and Dashboards to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data.

    "description": "The purpose of Public Finance (90-736/ [90-435](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=90-435 \"90-435\")) is to provide an introduction to the theory and practice of how national, regional and local governments should and actually finance their budgets for operating and capital project purposes. To accomplish this, the course reviews: i\\] rationales for government intervention in the market place, ii\\] analyzes methods of resolving conflicts over the size of the public sector budget, iii\\] extensively analyzes the rationales and issues of various types of tax revenue, and iv\\] reviews the effects of public sector spending and taxes on the aggregate economy. Throughout, Public Finance emphasizes the interplay between how current revenue policy is fashioned, and how the models and their key assumptions along with political processes interact which result in changes in current law at the federal, state, and local levels. While the examples are largely drawn from the US, examples are also drawn from around the world. Because the subject matter of public spending and revenues can easily consume an entire academic year of study, Public Finance focuses mainly on the revenue side of the public budget. Two courses typically offered by Professor Strauss in the Spring build on Public Finance. Public Expenditure Analysis (90-774/ [90-474](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=90-474 \"90-474\")) deals with techniques for evaluating private and public expenditure and capital spending decisions. Education Finance and Policy (90-817) deals in-depth with issues surrounding multi-level government finance from US and international perspectives. While Public Finance and Public Expenditure Analysis are self-contained, students who have had a semester of statistics and a semester of micro-economics at the principles or Advanced Placement levels will be more comfortable. For more information about Professor Strauss and this course, see respectively: www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rs9f under Teaching for the current course outline.

This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery. Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality, and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy. Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links the external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals, and outcomes.",

    "description": "This course prepares students to understand, interpret, and critique existing policy research. The course focuses on the development of three essential skills for policy analysts: 1) Read and interpret empirical results in published research. 2) Understand the assumptions needed to infer causal relationships and assess their plausibility. 3) Recognize common problems in policy research, including reverse causality, omitted variables, measurement error, etc., and use graphical methods to determine the direction of the resulting statistical bias. Using these three skills, students will practice understanding and critiquing policy research. Moreover, by identifying and understanding potential problems, students can make valid conclusions even from seriously flawed research. At the end of the class, students demonstrate these skills by independently evaluating an existing piece of research of their choice, presenting their findings in a written report and in-class presentation.

These techniques impact fields such as communication, healthcare, finance, policing, and workplace management. Instead of studying AI as a purely technical subject, in this course, we will critically examine the most recent developments and deployments of AI from a social, cultural and policy perspective. Drawing upon real-world cases, this course will introduce students to the basic concepts and main topics to think about AI socially, help them understand the potential benefits and pitfalls of various contemporary AI applications, and think towards future AI systems that can deliver greater social good. The course will include a mix of lectures, group discussions, guest lectures and small group in-class activities. Students will be asked to come to class having carefully read the required readings, submit response and discussion questions on Canvas and respond to each other. Building on concepts and cases discussed in this class, students will also be asked to write two policy memos (one mini, one final) on the topic of their choice.",

This course is for students that want to learn how to take ideas that respond to societal needs and frame it within a sustainable business structure. Ideas may be for new social ventures or innovations within existing institutions and corporations. The students will work on an idea they have and take it through a model \"accelerator\" program curriculum. Accelerators are \"fixed-term cohort-based programs that include seed investment, mentorship,\" a curriculum that aims to fast forward business planning and strategy and culminate in what is typically called \"demo day\" - an opportunity for participating teams to present to potential investors. The course is open to students from different disciplines. This course will utilize online resources as well as readings culled from leading resources on lean business planning. It is an applied learning course and will require working practical knowledge of basic financial statements. At the end of the course, students will be able to take an idea through a model accelerator curriculum - from establishing a mission, vision, theories of change and impact pathways to market and competitive analysis, identifying target markets, customer acquisition, basic financial modeling to crafting the pitch deck. Students will be able to understand a basic structure to business modeling that they can use to form the basic guiding foundations to future new ventures - as startups or as innovations within corporations.",

    "description": "Public Expenditure Analysis is a 12 unit course designed to deal with the expenditure side of the public sector budget in a series of modules. It has been conceptualized as a blending of private finance and public expenditure principles. The former provides a systematic framework, capital budgeting, for the evaluation of private-sector capital projects, while the latter builds on the former, and introduces issues of externality, the social rate of discount, and incomplete markets through the mechanism of shadow pricing. Public Expenditure Analysis prepares those Heinz and other CMU students seeking careers in the public sector, or those parts of the private sector that routinely deal with the public sector's capital budgeting decisions. It answers the question \"when should a community build a bridge?\" Public Expenditure Analysis is divided into 4 modules. In Module 1, the course develops the essential techniques of private sector evaluation principles for short-term and long-term capital projects. In Module 2, special problems which arise in the evaluation of public sector capital projects are discussed; a variety of evaluation techniques and applications especially suited to public sector projects are then examined. In Module 3, actual cost-benefit studies in the policy areas of education, environment, health, criminal justice, transportation and recreation are examined. In Module 4, evaluation at a high level of aggregation is dealt with through the use of generational accounting models. These models are examples of aggregate long and short-term public evaluation problem areas typically dealt with by national governments. Also in Module 4 groups of students perform and report a critical review of a cost-benefit study they have chosen. Throughout the course, similarities and differences between the public sector and private sector are emphasized, and examples from the real world are discussed in class.

How will emerging technologies reshape the US labor market? How important is the \"gig economy,\" and amp; how big might it become? What impact will the shocks generated by the COVID crisis and amp; rising inflation have on employment and amp; income inequality in the short run and amp; the long run? What can policy makers do to ensure that the growth of the American economy is more inclusive and amp; equitable? The curriculum has been rewritten to help students think seriously and amp; rigorously about the future of work in the 21st century American economy. The course will place current concerns in the broader context of the major structural shifts in the US labor market over the past several decades. Drawing upon the most recent quant analyses, the course will show that technological change has contributed to increasingly unequal outcomes in the US labor market for decades, and amp; that this trend is likely to continue as a new wave of technological change unfolds. The course will also consider the degree to which globalization, immigration, rising monopoly power, declining union strength, minimum wage laws, and amp; discrimination based on race and amp; gender have contributed to rising inequality in US incomes. The course will draw upon frontier research to identify old and amp; new policy ideas that could help make economic growth more inclusive, and amp; it will bring into the classroom policy entrepreneurs who are making a real difference.

This course will provide an opportunity for students to understand why that is the case and to explore what they can do about improving overall health outcomes through an understanding of population health. Students will be exposed to the leading frameworks of Population Health Management. Course content will help to determine the necessary building blocks, including the evaluation and implementation issues.   This introductory course will begin by providing an overview about population health and then addressing the key components in the field of population health. The issues we will examine include the way health care delivery systems, public health agencies, community-based organizations, and many other entities work together to develop interventions to improve the health outcomes in the local, national, and global communities they serve including policy consideration. Experts will be brought in to discuss the many ways that we can measure and address population health. The course includes a focus on improving health equity and reducing health disparities. Students will have the opportunity to identify a specific population health topic that is of specific interest to explore through independent research that comprises the main assignments for the course. The instructor will provide feedback and assistance to help students identify an issue that is of interest to them.    outcomes in the local, national, and global communities they serve. We will first learn to examine health issues from a population health perspective.

A geographic information system (GIS) provides an effective way to visualize, organize and manage a wide variety of information including administrative and medical record data, environmental health, social services, and other location data. Public health departments, hospitals, and medical research agencies are using GIS to map health-related events, identify disease clusters, investigate environmental health problems, and understand the spread of disease. This course uses a unique approach for teaching GIS in health care. It involves learning how to use GIS software in the context of carrying out projects for visualizing and analyzing health-related data. Each week includes lectures and computer labs that focus on a health, technical, or policy issue which use Esri's ArcGIS Pro and Platform technologies to analyze data or solve a problem. Students learn to create Story Maps and Dashboards to convey their maps and associated text to the public and decision makers. Through assignments and projects students will not only learn how to use the software but will also learn the many distinctive advantages of using GIS for health care policy making and planning. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient background so that they can become expert users of GIS in health organizations - building, managing, and using GIS maps and health data.

This introduction provides a framework to aid students in navigating from public policy through to healthcare delivery. Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality, and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy. Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links the external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process. Its promise is to promote better decision making by envisioning how micro decisions interconnect to mission, goals, and outcomes.

Getting signatory countries' laws and regulations to be consonant with the provisions of these conventions is only the first stage of what is, in fact, a two-stage implementation process. The second stage is the enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations. This stage, which fosters deterrence and strengthens the rule of law vital to economic development, will be the focus of the course. The course will examine cases of grand corruption across the world, including in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Among the countries to be covered will be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and others. The course will discuss different strategies and solutions that leaders in governments, non-government organisations and private sector can consider to improve, at a global level, the implementation of UNCAC and OECD anti-bribery convention. At the national level, the course will discuss and develop recommendations to enhance the enforcement of anti-corruption laws in terms of effective detection, investigation, prosecution and sanctions against corruption, with due consideration to different country contexts.

With its rational choice perspective, the economic perspective has tended to favor certain types of policies, namely those that enhance the efficiency of market mechanisms and lower the cost of information. In this course we will spend the first several classes reviewing the assumptions, implications for public policy, and limitations of the rational choice perspective. The remainder of the course will then be devoted to examining different public policy issues, including saving, health care, crime and drug abuse, through the competing lenses of traditional and behavioral economics.\" Course Website: [https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses\\_api/course\\_detail/90-882](https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course_detail/90-882) ## Faculty LEMAN AKOGLU, Dean's Associate Professor of Information Systems – PhD, Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon, 2012– LINDA BABCOCK, James M.
